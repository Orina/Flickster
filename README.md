# Project 1 - *Flickster*

**Flickster** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [X] Layout is optimized with the [ViewHolder](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView#improving-performance-with-the-viewholder-pattern) pattern.
* [X] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [X] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [X] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Improved the user interface through styling and coloring.

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [X] Allow user to view details of the movie including genres, release date and running time within a separate activity.
* [X] When viewing a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should show the full backdrop image as the layout.  Uses [Heterogenous ListViews](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Implementing-a-Heterogenous-ListView) or [Heterogenous RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) to show different layouts.
* [X] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.
    * [X] Overlay a play icon for videos that can be played.
    * [X] More popular movies should start a separate activity that plays the video immediately.
    * [X] Less popular videos rely on the detail page should show ratings and a YouTube preview.
* [X] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [X] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Picasso transformations](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#other-transformations)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Implemented MVP pattern
* [X] Implemented Json objects parsing in background thread using HandlerThread
* [X] Implemented movies repository - app stores already loaded movies into memory cache.
* [X] After the movie video has ended, the app will show the movie's details page. I.e. YoutubeListener interface is implemented and method onVideoEnded() is overriden.
